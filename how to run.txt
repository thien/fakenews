You'll need to install keras, numpy and nltk!

If you want, you can download the glove dataset directly via this url:
http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip

The resulting zip file should be placed in the /datafiles directory.

Other than that, put the news_ds.csv in the same directory as the other code and run python3 main.py.
